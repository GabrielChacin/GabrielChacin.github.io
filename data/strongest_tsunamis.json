In the epicentral zone, it lasted about a half minute and caused numerous slides and subsidences of the loose ground. Many points of low-lying accumulative coastal relief forms: beaches at steep cliffs, spits, etc., disappeared. \r\n<P>The end of the spit, which cuts off Deep Bay, disappeared under water. The depth of the water to the north of the spit increased from 1.5 to 30 m. Apparently, the wave resulting from this slide reached the lighthouse situated to the east on Sisters Rock. Acoording to the lighthouse attendant, a wave 2-2.5 m high rolled onto the little island 7 minutes after the earthquake; a second wave 0.25-0.5 m high moved in at a distance of 30 m from the first; the velocity of the waves was 10 knots.\r\n<P>A section of coast with a pier on Goose Spit which cuts off the entrance to Comox Harbor, subsided more than 0.5 m. Waves about a meter high were observed near the slide which occurred here.\r\n<P>Some sections subsided on Rebecca Spit, which cuts off Drew Harbor on the eastern coast of Quadra Island. According to a forest worker, a moment after the earthquake, the water level oscillated between the high and low tide marks at another place on this island. The water, which had been clear, became turbid. The fish did not bite for two weeks. A large tract of agricultural lands on Reid Island dropped 6-9 m.\r\n<P>In Alberni Bay opposite Franklin Creek, the water increased more than 30 m in depth. The underwater cable was broken and partially buried by detritus. In the words of an eyewitness, a roller 6-9 m high, arose on the surface of the water here. The roller then scattered along the axis of the bay and turned into small tidal waves, which were observed on its shores.\r\n<P>According to Hodgson (reference #2598), who carefully examined the epicenter zone of the earthquake, there were no real tsunami waves. Only these local waves arose, which were generated by collapses and suspension currents. A distinctive feature of this earthquake was the almost total absence of recurrent shocks.\r\n<BR>(above from reference #415)\r\n<P>Based on dendrochronological analysis, tsunami deposits and aerial photographs Evans states: The 1946 Vancouver Island earthquake (M = 7.2) triggered a rock avalanche from the north face of Mount Colonel Foster, central Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The resultant displacement wave ran up a maximum vertical distance of 51 m on the opposite shore and the wave crest was about 29 m high when it spilled over the lip of the lake. Water displaced during the event destroyed forest in the upper reaches of the Elk River valley up to 3 km from Landslide Lake.

The earthquake and tsunami associated with it were responsible for the destruction of at least six fishing villages and the death of hundreds of people in the Narino State of Colombia. At least 15 other coastal towns in the area were rocked by the earthquake and were damaged by the waves. Waves measuring anywhere from 2-5 meters destroyed many of these coastal villages. People along the coast, who survived the earthquake by running outside their homes, were carried away a few minutes later by the large tsunami waves generated by the earthquake. Six fishing boats, one with 40 men aboard, were lost. A pier on the prison island of Gorgona was destroyed, however, no injuries from either the earthquake or the tsunami were reported from there. Most of the houses at Charco, a village of 4,000 which were built on stilts over a lake were knocked into the water. Waves sent the Iscuande River out of its banks along the Pacific coast. The wall of water reportedly in the village of Iscuande caused extensive damages. At least one person was reported dead from that area.\r\n<P>Hardest hit of all the coastal villages was the fishing village of San Juan, where the waves completely overran the island destroying just about everything in their path. Numerous deaths were reported from San Juan which was totally devastated and is in the process of being relocated further inland at the present time. According to eyewitness reports, 3 to 4 waves were observed, the first wave arriving approximately 10 minutes after the main earthquake. The water recessed first to about 3 meters below the level of the sea. The first wave arrived minutes later. The third wave was the largest, and at San Juan Island it was approximately 5 meters above the level of the tide, which fortunately, was at its lowest at that time.\r\n<P>The maximum difference between low and high tide in the region for that time of the year was approximately 1.3 meters, thus, the maximum wave could have been that much more, if it had arrived at high tide, and numerous more deaths could have resulted. Considering that the mean elevation of the coastal islands is approximately 2 to 2.5 meters above high tide, it would mean that maximum waves would have completely overrun all of the coastal islands in the area. Approximately 30-35 km of the coast was hardest hit by the tsunami, while the length of the area hardest hit by the earthquake was approximately 225 km in length, from Guapi to Tumaco.\r\n<P><B>It is estimated that the majority of casualties (at least 80%) were the result of the tsunami rather than of the earthquake.

The city of Esmeraldas was nearly inundated by a tidal wave which entered the port, flooding the principal streets. All the inhabitants ran for the mountains in the neighborhood. All the towns in the provinces of Esmeraldas and Manabi were greatly damaged. Most of the inhabitants are homeless.

The explosion of the Krakatau Volcano in Indonesia generated a 30-m tsunami in the Sundra Strait that destroyed numerous towns and killed about 36,000 people. The explosion was heard about 3,000 miles away. It also caused an atmospheric pressure wave that was recorded on the tide gages at remote locations including South Georgia Island, Panama, France, England, Hawaii, Alaska, and San Francisco. Due to the shadowing by continents and island groups, a direct tsunami could not have reached most of these locations. Harkrider and Press (1967) show that the direct air waves (acoustic) are the first to be recorded. Atmospheric gravity waves with phase and group velocities nearer the oceanic gravity wave velocity (sqrt(gd)) occurred and may have excited water waves (tsunamis) by transferring energy to the ocean. The longer the fetch, the more energy that would be transferred.\r\nThese waves are the most energetic and are created beyond the land mass shadow zones. The initial acoustic waves, too, may create resonances in the coastal and harbor areas as seiches. To consider these to be true tsunamis is a stretch of the definition but atmospheric gravity waves are or may be a source for tidal disturbance which resemble tsunamis.

A number of castles, towers, and other tall structures collapsed. Then roarings like thunder were heard towards the sea.

In Wellington, the ship Pandora was anchored in 11 m of water. According to the captain, the shocks that were generated during the earthquake, which lasted over a minute, felt as if the ship was hitting rough bottom. Disembarking with his mate onto the beach, the captain became aware of a rapid succession of ebbs and flows. The waves were observed for at least 50 minutes, as they rolled over the shore of South Island. A \"terrible\" tidal wave rushed onto the shore. (reference #415) <P>The 1855 January 23 0932 UT 2111 Local time MW8.2-8.4 Wairarapa earthquake generated New Zealand\u0092s largest historical locally-generated tsunami. The tsunami most affected the Cook Strait region, where the Wairarapa Fault and subsidiary faults (Wharekauhau Thrust and small play fault) ruptured beneath Cook Strait causing significant uplift (up to 6.4 m) of a large region west of the fault on the northern side of the strait and a small amount of subsidence on the southern side. The effects of the tsunami were observed at least as far north as Waikawa Beach, where fish were deposited above high water mark, and as far south as the Clarence River mouth and possibly Kaikoura, although evidence for the latter is equivocal. A bore in the Avon River attributed by De Lange & Healy (1986) to tsunami and the \u0093great sea wave\u0094 in Otago harbour (Davie, 1870) were almost certainly seismically induced seiches, not tsunami. Seiches, often confused with tsunami on the coast, were observed in coastal rivers and estuaries at Wairoa (Hawke\u0092s Bay), Motupipi in Golden Bay, Kaiapoi and at Lyttelton, as well as in many inland water bodies. The greatest known height (10-11 m) reached by the tsunami was at Te Kopi in Palliser Bay, where a shed on a cliff 9 m above the sea was swept away. Here also, on the night of the earthquake and tsunami, a sailor who had experienced a tsunami in South America, persuaded a family to leave the shore. Nearby, at Whangaimoana, a tool that had been on the shore at the time of the earthquake was found many years later in a location 10 m above high water mark. High waves were also observed along the coast south of Wellington and along the Wairau Bar on the southern shore of Cook Strait, probably reaching 6-7 m near Rarangi. In Lyall Bay the tsunami swept about 2-2.5 km inland, inundating what is now the suburb of Miramar. The sea sweeping in from Lyall Bay (est. height above sea level at time, 4-5 m) reportedly met the water sweeping in from Evans Bay, on the Wellington Harbour side of Rongotai Isthmus (est. height above sea level at time 3-4 m). Within Wellington Harbour, water levels varied considerably. At Petone and along the road to the Hutt Valley, fish were deposited (the tide was high at the time of the earthquake) but the water levels do not seem to have reached much more than a metre or so above normal. However, the shops along the beach front at Lambton Quay (now on reclaimed land 200 m from the shore) were inundated with waves about 1.4-2.4 m above sea level at the time immediately after or during the earthquake. Barnett et al. (1991) (Grapes & Downes (1997)) separated the source of the tsunami within the harbour into three different components: the horizontal movement, causing an immediate \u0093slosh\u0094; differential vertical movement across the harbour; and the much greater deformation in Cook Strait and extending across the whole region west of the fault. For a local source tsunami, the duration seems to have been quite long, observations consistently indicating that in Wellington harbour and in Cook Strait water levels oscillated for 8-12 hours. It was also said that the tides were irregular for a week (see entries for January 24-31, January 24 and February 3).

The tsunami of this year [1737], according to some data, can be considered the strongest of all those known on Kamchatka and the Kurile Islands. Detailed accounts of the phenomenon are listed below. <P>Through persons who have come from the Kuril, from the islands and from Cape Lopatka, also from Avacha, I have learned that there was a great earth tremor there, which began at all of the places mentioned at the same time. <P>On the first of the Kurile Islands, called Sumshchu [Shumehu], the earthquake was of the following form. On October 17 [October 6 Julian calendar] at 3 o'clock in the night the earth shook so sharply at first that many huts fell down. This quake came in waves from the SSE, and as soon as the shaking ceased suddenly came from the sea with great noise about 3 sazhens [6 m] of water, which immediately went out again far to sea. <P>With the recession of the water the earth shook again, only very slightly, and afterwards the water again came from the sea to the same place where it had been the first time. After a quarter of an hour the waters of the sea for the third time, with a very great noise, came up to about 10 sazhens higher than the previous places, which carried away many native dwellings. This water ran off again into the sea and throughout two days rose and fell. <P>Around Lopatka and at Avacha the quake began at the same date and hour, only it was slight the first time, but the second and third times it was as on the island, very sharp, so that many huts fell down. After the third time, the water came from the sea with a great noise, about 15 sazhens high, covering - all of the low places round about and also the lower hills. It carried away many native dwellings, baggage, food, and skin boats and caused no little loss to the Russians who were there at the time, who, leaving all of their baggage in the yurts, had to flee to high ground and there seek to save themselves. Between the rivers Viliuchik and the Avacha cove a small new cove was made. The place where the cove was formed was a meadow with kliukva and shiksha berries and two huts stood there in which the natives had put food. At the time of the great water the huts were carried away with the ground and two native women and a man who were in the huts were drowned. <P>An excerpt from a journal provide grounds for supposing that in 1737 strong tsunamis also lashed the Komandorsky Islands: <P>The greatest changes on the island [Bering] may have resulted from earthquakes and high sea tides. Indubitable signs of powerful inundations were driftwood, bones of whales, and whole skeletons of sea cows which had been carried high up on the shores or far into ravines toward the center of the island. By the age of the drift logs I could conclude quite confidently that in the inundation of 1738 [an obvious error; 1737 is meant] on the coasts of Kamchatka and the Kurile Islands, the waters also lashed Bering Island to a height greater than 30 sazhene [64 m]<P>(above from reference #413) <P>Reference #11787 states the following regarding Georg W.

The epicenter was located on the northern coast of Cross Sound near Palma Bay.  Underwater cables were broken in Juneau, Skagway, and Wrangell.  A local submarine slump off Khantaak Island in Yakutat Bay caused <B>3 deaths<\/B> and wrecked a boat.  Lituya Bay, the site of repeated huge local tsunamis, experienced a massive landslide which generated a surge of water reaching 525 meters in height -- 400 feet higher than the Empire State Building.  2 boats were wrecked, and <B>2 deaths<\/B> resulted.  30 million cubic meters of soil and loose material were washed away, along with ten square km of forest.  Shellfish colonies, a cabin, and mining equipment were also destroyed by this massive surge.  Total property damage --primarily from the three lost boats -- exceeded $100,000 (Reference #239).\r\n<P>The earthquake caused numerous rock avalanches and slides. In Disenchantment Bay, a \"chunk\" weighing several tons broke off from a glacier descending to the water; waves 6 m high arose on the surface of the bay. On Khantaak Island, the sea waves resulting from a coastal section submerging under water reached a height of 5-6 m. A collapse in the mouth of the Alsek River caused a wave 1-2 m high, which spread upriver. The water level in the lower reaches dropped approximately 1 m; several hours later, the dam was breached and the shores of the river were flooded. In Glacier Bay, rocks crashed down from the steep beaches, resulting in small waves no more than 1\/2-1 m (2-3 feet) high. Similar waves were observed in Dixon Harbor several minutes after the earthquake. The most catastrophic events, unique in the history of strong earthquakes, occurred in Lituya Bay, which is the T-shaped bed of an ancient glacier that has been filled in with water. The distinctive feature of the bay is the strong tidal currents at the throat, reaching 12 knots in velocity. At the time of the earthquake, about 300 million square meters of rock collapsed into Gilbert Bay from the northeast shore. The water extruded from the bay by the collapsing mass, splashed up on the opposite shore, reaching a colossal height. The movement of the water was so fast, that it uprooted a whole forest in the flood zone and stripped the bark and branches from the trees. Besides this gigantic splash, the collapse of this huge mass gave rise to a wave, which crossed the entire Lituya Bay from Gilbert Bay to the sea with a velocity of 150-200 km\/hr, that is, with the speed of gravity waves, and devastated the shores of Lituya Bay. The tectonic dislocations in the source of the earthquake, and possibly the wave emerging from Lituya Bay, gave rise to a small tsunami, which was registered on remote tide gauges (Reference #415).\r\n<P>The main mass of the slide, as outlined on figure 16, is a prism of rock that is roughly triangular in cross section, with dimensions of 2,400 feet and 3,000 foot along tho slope, a maximum thickness of about 300 feet normal to the slope, and a center of gravity at about 2,000 foot altitude. From those dimensions and an assumed specific gravity of 2.7, the volume and weight of tho rock mass are, respectively, <B>40 million cubic yards and 90 million tons<\/B>. It is highly probable that this entire mass plunged into Gilbert Inlet as a unit at the time of the earthquake, although tho only known fact is that it fell between about noon on July 7 and about 10 .m on July 10.

Magnitude 7.5, Guam Island. There was a destructive earthquake on the Mariana Islands. A tsunami occurred. [The tsunami was generated by an earthquake on the 24th or the 25th.] One of the eyewitnesses, who was on board a ship riding in the bay, gave the following account of the effects of the main earthquake and the tsunami in Umatac Bay: \"The first, main earthquake began with an exceptional trembling of the water, which was then transmitted to the land. The displacements of the ground were so large that all stone and brick buildings suffered to some extent, and many completely collapsed. One of my boats were taking on a supply of water in the mouth of the river. It was caught by the flood tide, and almost tossed on to the trees. Barrels and other objects were carried 1\/2 km (1\/4 mile) or more from the shore to open sea. When the wave rolled back, hundreds of fishes were left on the dried bottom. The shore near the river dropped about 3 1\/2 m (12 feet). The wave entrained the ship with such force, that it could not hold to its anchors. The water ran up onto the island in an east-west direction. A mild northeasterly wind was blowing.\"\r\nIn the Inarajan region (southeast coast), a woman was caught up by the wave near the Talofofo River, and never reappeared.

There was a strong earthquake on Tanna Island; the subsequent tremors lasted four weeks. A new pit of crater formed near the \"sulphur bay\" [in Sapper's unlikely opinion, this was the result of a volcanic explosion]. Two minutes [?] later, the coast rose 6 m along the entire western side of Resolution Harbor. The anchorages in the bay were correspondingly restricted; at one place, where ships with a displacement of 1000-1500 tons used to ride freely, an old sunken anchor became visible. The earthquake generated a roller 12 m high, or 15-17 m high, according to other sources, which inundated the eastern tip of the harbor and destroyed all the canoes of the local residents an all the plantations.
